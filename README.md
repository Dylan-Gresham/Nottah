# **Nottah**

## Overview

This program was made to simply be a note taking application for classes. It isn't intended to be a replacement for Google Docs or Microsoft Word but is meant to be able
to make new txt files, open existing ones, and be able to modify and save txt files.

### Current Capabilities

* Open txt files
* Save txt files
* Edit txt files
* Switch between taking and reading notes

## Downloading & Using

To Download:
* Download the latest release from the [Github page](https://github.com/DylanGresham/nottah)
* Locate the Nottah.jar file in the target folder
* Move Nottah.jar to desired location/pin to taskbar

To Use:
* Open Nottah.jar to open the starting window.
* Starting window will always be a blank text box ready to be edited
* To open an existing text file:
  * Click the Open button
  * Navigate to desired file, select it and open it
* To save the text in the text box of Nottah:

* To switch between taking and reading notes, click the check box to the right of the Save button.

## Future Plans

* Switch from JavaFX to Electron.js or Qt
* Implement opening to last file edited
* Improve visual design of the program (requires more skill & creativity with CSS)
* Animation on opening/closing the program
